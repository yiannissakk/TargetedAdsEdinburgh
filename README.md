# TargetedAdsEdinburgh

A marketing client would like to run advertising for the calendar year of 2018 (Jan – Dec). They have asked for the advertising to be geographically targeted to Edinburgh and to hours when the weather is warm and dry (over 10OC and less than 75% humidity). From our stats, we see that we can target 100,000 ads to Edinburgh for any hour of the year.

You can find the weather data in the data folder of this repository:

Using an open-source Big Data technology (Spark, Hadoop, Pig etc.), take the average temperature for each hour of a year, using the data from years 2007 to 2014.

Using this data, propose the maximum that could be spent on advertising if the advertising space cost £5CPM (£5 per 1000 ads delivered)
